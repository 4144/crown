 - Generic tasks
  > Complete the basic windowing and openGl setup.
   . Let's do it!
     [Descr]: Once decided the structure and interfaces, implement them in both
              linux and windows.
     [State]: Work in progress.

  > Implement basic data structures.
   . List<T>
     [Descr]: A class that wraps a typed array, and exposes an interface to man
              ipulate it.
     [State]: Completed.

   . String
     [Descr]: Handles a character array and exposes it as a string with methods
              to manipulate it as a string and not a char array.
     [Note]: An useful feature would be Copy On Write (COW) behaviour. Also usi
             ng a StringPool as data allocator could be convenient for memory a
             nd speed reasons.
     [State]: Basic implementation completed.

   . Dictionary<TKey, TValue>
     [Descr]: A class to build dictionaries.
              Required specifications are O(log(n)) speed for frequent function
              s, such as:
              - insert(TKey, TValue)
              - remove(TKey)
              - find(TKey)
              - contains(TKey)
     [State]: Completed.

  > Enumerators. (See Enumerators.txt for further info)
   . Implementation
     [Descr]: Implement enumeration capabilites for structures that can expose 
              them.
     [State]: Supported containers:
              - List<T>: Forward and Backward enumeration.
              - Dictionary<Tkey, TValue>: Forward and Backward enumeration.

  > Memory management.
   . ManagedObject
     [Descr]: Object base for objects whose memory should be tracked.
     [State]: Functionality present, but to be optimized. (This far, it has a l
              ot of overhead)
   . GarbageBin
     [Descr]: A Garbage collector that receives objects that must be deleted at
              the end of the frame.
     [State]: Completed.

   . WeakPointer<T>
     [Descr]: A pointer wrapper that becomes NULL automatically when the pointe
              d objects gets destroyed.
     [State]: To be implemented.

  > Gui Subsystem. (See Gui.txt for info)
   . Widget Skeleton
     [Descr]: A solid base Widget that allows to build a tree representation of
              Gui Objects.
     [State]: Expanding methods as needed

   . Window
     [Descr]: A Window Widget with common functionalities and quick gestures.
     [State]: Work in progress.

   . WindowsManager
     [Descr]: A Windows manager that handles windows and generates mouse and ke
              yboards events for them.
     [State]: Event system defined, introducing new events as needed
		 					- Replace OnEvents params with proper structures

   . Default Widgets
     [Descr]: A set of ready to use widgets that offer the most common function
              alities.
     [State]: Work in progress.
