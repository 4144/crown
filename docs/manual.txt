Introduction
============

What is it?
-----------

Crown is a general purpose data-driven game engine, written from scratch in orthodox C++ with a minimalistic and data-oriented design philosophy in mind.

It is loosely inspired by Bitsquid (now Stingray) engine and its design principles.

Supported platforms
-------------------

* Android (14+, ARM)
* Linux
* Windows

Basics
======

The .bundleignore file
======================

Many programs store metadata files alongside edited files. This is often the case with text editors and version control systems.

When Crown bumps into unknown files in the source directory, it quits the compilation and reports an error.

The ``.bundleignore`` file specifies files that Crown should ignore when compiling data.

Example
-------

.. code::

  # This is a comment.

  # Blank lines are ignored.
  # Everything else is simple glob pattern (*, ?).
  *.txt
