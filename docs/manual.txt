Introduction
============

What is it?
-----------

Crown is a general purpose data-driven game engine, written from scratch in orthodox C++ with a minimalistic and data-oriented design philosophy in mind.

It is loosely inspired by Bitsquid (now Stingray) engine and its design principles.

Supported platforms
-------------------

* Android (14+, ARM)
* Linux
* Windows

Basics
======

Units of measurement
--------------------

Crown uses MKS (meters, kilograms and seconds) units and radians for angles.

The .bundleignore file
======================

Many programs store metadata files alongside edited files. This is often the case with text editors and version control systems.

When Crown bumps into unknown files in the source directory, it quits the compilation and reports an error.

The ``.bundleignore`` file specifies files that Crown should ignore when compiling data.

Example
-------

.. code::

  # This is a comment.

  # Blank lines are ignored.
  # Everything else is simple glob pattern (*, ?).
  *.txt

Command line reference
======================

	``-h --help``
		Display the help.

	``-v --version``
		Display engine version.

	``--source-dir <path>``
		Use <path> as the source directory for resource compilation.

		The <path> must be absolute.

	``--bundle-dir <path>``
		Use <path> as the destination directory for compiled resources.

		The <path> must be absolute.

	``--boot-dir <path>``
		Boot the engine with the ``boot.config`` from given <path>.

		The <path> must be relative.

	``--compile``
		Do a full compile of the resources.

		When using this option you must also specify ``--platform``, ``--source-dir`` and ``--bundle-dir``.

	``--platform <platform>``
		Compile resources for the given <platform>.
		Possible values for <platform> are:

		* ``android``
		* ``linux``
		* ``windows``

	``--continue``
		Run the engine after resource compilation.

	``--console-port <port>``
		Set port of the console.

		When no port is specified, the engine uses the port 10001.

	``--wait-console``
		Wait for a console connection before starting up.

	``--parent-window <handle>``
		Set the parent window <handle> of the main window.
