/**
	Column major 3x3 matrix.

	The engine uses column vectors for coordinate space transformations
	so you'll have to specify transformations in reverse order.
	e.g. (rotation translation vector) will produce the result of first translating
	and then rotating the vector.
	Also note that a column major matrix needs to be placed to the left of a
	vector by matrix multiplication, so, to multiply a vector by a matrix you'll have
	to write something like: matrix vector. Since we are also using column vectors, inverting
	the operands would result in an impossible operation.

@verbatim:
	  X base vector
		| Y base vector
		|   | Z base vector
		|   |   |
	1 [ Xx  Yx  Zx ]
	2 | Xy  Yy  Zy |
	3 [ Xz  Yz  Zz ]
		1   2   3
