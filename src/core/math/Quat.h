/**
	Quaternion.

@Note:
	This implementation uses the standard quaternion
	multiplication equation, so, the order of multiplication
	for multiple rotations is in a reverse fashion:
	p' = qpq^-1 where p is the point32_t and q the rotation quaternion

	p' = (ba)p(ba)^-1 where p is the point32_t and (ba) the concatenation of two successive rotations
	In this case, the point32_t p is first rotated by the quaternion a and then by the quaternion b.
	The transformation order is reversed.
